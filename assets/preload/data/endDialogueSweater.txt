Happy:Maku:That was sooo nice!
Happy:Mace:Thank you! I wrote the song myself.
Surprised:Maku:Oh! I just remembered why I wanted to talk to you! 
Neutral:Maku:I wanted to know if you're able to make it to the big game in a couple of weeks?
Neutral:Mace:Of course! You said you wanted me to record it too, right?
Neutral:Maku:Yeah! I figured since you're, like, an A/V nerd and all, I think you'd do a great job!
Neutral:Mace:Maku... I'm just hitting the record button on my phone.
Giggling:Maku:I don't know, it always looks better when you handle the camera, okay? Anyway, I gotta go for practice!
Happy:Mace:Gotcha, see ya later!
Happy:Maku:Bye, hon!
